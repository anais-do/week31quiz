<h2>My favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
<p>My favorite part of Patino is the environment it provides.
Both the interior and student climate is nice. For example,
all the rooms are not over filled with people and provide a
good space where groups of people can work. Also, the students
here are much friendlier than those of other high schools.

<h2>My least favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
<p>My least favorite part about Patino is the school spirit.
Since there are only about 300 students here, there is not a
lot of people who partake in school activities. For example,
our dances are quiet as well as our rallies. </p>
